## Before Uploading to Wix

### Step 1: Rename Images
Give them descriptive names that reflect the project:

**Suggested Naming Convention:**
- `project-01-kitchen-remodel.jpg`
- `project-02-bathroom-luxury.jpg`
- `project-03-commercial-office.jpg`
- `project-04-home-exterior.jpg`
- `project-05-custom-millwork.jpg`
- `project-06-master-bathroom.jpg`
- `project-07-modern-kitchen.jpg`
- `project-08-residential-addition.jpg`
- `project-09-basement-renovation.jpg`
- `project-10-outdoor-living.jpg`

### Step 2: Optimize File Size

**Online Tools (Free):**
- **TinyPNG:** https://tinypng.com (PNG compression)
- **Compressor.io:** https://compressor.io (All formats)
- **Squoosh:** https://squoosh.app (Google's tool)

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Format:** JPG for photographs (better compression)
- **Quality:** 80-85% (good balance of quality/size)
- **Max Width:** 1920px (for full-width display)
- **Target Size:** Under 500KB per image (under 200KB ideal)

### Step 3: Add Alt Text in Wix

When uploading each image to Wix, add descriptive alt text for SEO:

**Examples:**
- "Modern kitchen remodeling project by NP Services LLC"
- "Luxury bathroom renovation with custom tilework"
- "Commercial office space renovation in Alabama"
- "Complete home exterior transformation"
- "Outdoor Transformations and built-in cabinetry"
- "Master bathroom with spa-quality fixtures"
- "Contemporary kitchen design with premium finishes"
- "Residential addition and structural expansion"
- "Finished basement renovation project"
- "Outdoor living space construction"

## Batch Rename Script (Optional)

If you want to rename all files at once, use this terminal command:

```bash
cd "user uploads"

# Rename files (adjust names as needed)
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 225517.png" "project-01.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 225644.png" "project-02.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 225726.png" "project-03.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 225800.png" "project-04.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 225827.png" "project-05.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 225940.png" "project-06.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 230027.png" "project-07.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 230119.png" "project-08.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 230205.png" "project-09.png"
mv "Screenshot 2026-01-04 230237.png" "project-10.png"
```

## Image Best Practices

### For Web Performance:

- Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- Add descriptive filenames
- Include alt text for accessibility and SEO
- Test load speed after upload

❌ **DON'T:**
- Upload original high-res files (unnecessarily large)
- Use generic names like "IMG_001.jpg"
- Forget alt text (hurts SEO)
- Upload images larger than needed
- Skip mobile optimization testing

## Expected Results

### After Optimization:
- **Before:** ~2-5 MB per image (PNG screenshots)
- **After:** ~200-500 KB per image (optimized JPG)
- **Total savings:** ~80-90% reduction in file size
- **Result:** Faster website loading times

### Wix Limits:
- **Max file size:** 25 MB per image
- **Recommended:** Under 5 MB per image
- **Ideal:** Under 500 KB per image
- **Storage:** Varies by Wix plan (usually 500 MB - 50 GB)
